# 1) Setting up the Window with LWJGL


setting up the project and then setting up a window.

## IntelliJ

url = https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/

We are going to be using intelliJ for the IDE, download and then open a new project and select gradle on left pane. Only need groupid for maven projects so that can be left blank. Set `Artifactid` to the name you wish to call your project. Then pick where to save it.

next generate the gradle for LWJGL at https://www.lwjgl.org/customize
